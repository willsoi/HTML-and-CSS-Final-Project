The FIFA World Cup, often simply called the World Cup, is an international association football competition 
contested by the senior men's national teams of the members of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), 
the sport's global governing body. The championship has been awarded every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930, 
except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held because of the Second World War. The current champions are France, 
who won their second title at the 2018 tournament in Russia.
The current format involves a qualification phase, which takes place over the preceding three years, to determine which 
teams qualify for the tournament phase. In the tournament phase, 32 teams compete for the title at venues within 
the host nation(s) over about a month. The host nation(s) automatically qualify.
As of the 2018 FIFA World Cup, twenty-one final tournaments have been held and a total of 79 national teams have competed. 
The trophy has been won by eight national teams. Brazil have won five times, and they are the only team to have 
played in every tournament. The other World Cup winners are Germany and Italy, with four titles each; Argentina, 
France, and inaugural winner Uruguay, with two titles each; and England and Spain, with one title each.
The World Cup is the most prestigious association football tournament in the world, as well as the most widely viewed 
and followed single sporting event in the world. The cumulative viewership of all matches of the 2006 World Cup was 
estimated to be 26.29 billion with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the final match, a ninth of the entire 
population of the planet.[1][2][3][4]
17 countries have hosted the World Cup. Brazil, France, Italy, Germany, and Mexico have each hosted twice, while 
Uruguay, Switzerland, Sweden, Chile, England, Argentina, Spain, the United States, Japan and South Korea (jointly), 
South Africa, and Russia have each hosted once. Qatar is hosting the 2022 tournament, and 2026 will be jointly hosted by 
Canada, the United States, and Mexico, which will give Mexico the distinction of being the first country to host 
games in three World Cups.<br>
